# Prime_Palindromes_in_Pi
 This algorithm uses Fermat's Theorem of Prime decomposition and a direct list analysis for 
 finding the first L-length prime palindrome in the decimal expansion of Pi.


# Text-Finding
    The program utilizes a text-file as local data for Pi. Depending on how much accuracy is required, more
    decimals may be loaded into the text file. For this demonstration, we used a lot of different text-files.

# Beware the Indexes

    Had no time (yet) to check everything, and some index locations for the palindromes are still inaccurate.
    Please take these with a grain of salt!
